# Contributing Guidelines

These guidelines will apply to all branches unless otherwise stated.

### Notices
- Currently, the `gen2` branch is in focus for development. All changes intended for `gen2` should be in a PR pointing to the `gen2` branch
- `main` branch should reflect latest releases only. Do not submit a PR targetting `main` unless on rare occasions (typos mainly)
- `dev` branch pertains to pending merges to `main` awaiting release
